The remote laboratory is integrated into the OSCAR IDE. Remote clients can select a set of sensor inputs to use for their computations to generate an output of motion control commands. Users can collect real-time sensor data from the OSCAR platform while monitoring a video stream from cameras installed in the laboratory.
